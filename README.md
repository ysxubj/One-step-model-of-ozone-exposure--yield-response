# One-step-model-of-ozone-exposure--yield-response
This is a repository for calculating the dose-response relationship between O3 and wheat yield

We develop a method to fit the O3 dose relationship with crop yield and yield components in Nature Food (doi.org/10.1038/s43016-021-00422-6). Here we publish the R code to conduct the calculation.
