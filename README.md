# Wheat yield loss to ozone differs among regions
This is a repository for compare wheat yield and yield components response to elevated O3 around the word (China, India, Europe and North America)
The code and data were used in the manuscript "Wheat yield response to elevated O3 concentrations differs between the world's major producing regions".

Three files were included in this repository.
01 estimated Dose relationship:
We develop a method to fit the O3 dose relationship with crop yield and yield components here. The details of the equations could be find in the manuscript

02relationships between AOT40 and O3
We explore the relationships betwen AOT40 and hourly O3 concentration using Chinese, European and American O3 observation.

This method was developed by Prof. Kazuhiko Kobayashi, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. It was implemented using R by Dr. Yansen Xu, University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China. These studies were supervised by Prof. Zhaozhong Feng, University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China.
