# Wheat yield loss to ozone differs among regions
This is a repository for compare wheat yield response to elevated O3 around the word (China, India, Europe and North America)
The code and data were used in the manuscript "Wheat yield response to elevated O3 concentrations differs between the world’s major producing regions".

Four files were included in this repository.

01 estimated Dose relationship:
We develop a method to fit the O3 dose relationship with crop yield and yield components here. 

02relationships between AOT40 and O3
We explore the relationships betwen AOT40 and hourly O3 concentration using Chinese, European and American O3 observation.

03Plot
Here are codes for plot figures in the manuscript.

04Wheat_meta.analysis_ref
The references used in this manuscript.
